        money with incomplete orders due to broken units and save yourself the messy clean up by switching to Perma Pad
        today. At Tepco, we acknowledge the importance of diminishing waste in our communities. We are excited to offer
        a product made from recycled plastic. All pads proudly display the recycled symbol, to recognize the extra step
        taken toward helping protect our environment. Perma Pad can endure more abuse than any other pad on the market.
