   <p>Although there are standard designs, expanded metal is infinitely variable in pattern, and can be specified to achieve any critical characteristics. 
       A larger pattern size will increase open area, light, sound diffusion, and cost-effectiveness. Changing the strand width alters appearances and weight. 
       In fact, expanded metal actually has a higher strength to weight ratio than in its previous sheet metal state. Standard expanded metal provides rigidity, while flattened expanded metal has a smoother and safer surface. Note the difference below in bond sheared edges vs random sheared edges.</p>
