    <h2 class = "page-heading"> Welcome to Central Expanded Metal</h2>
    <p>Established in 1985, Central Expanded Metal, Inc. is an innovative expanded metal manufacturer, supplying
        engineered products to customers across North America. We pride ourselves in our commitment to customer
        satisfaction. Working in conjunction with both our production staff and sales department, our full-time customer

        with a dedication you will appreciate. <br>
        <span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 1rem;">Free from scrap and raveling, expanded metal can be
            expanded up to ten times its original size, allowing it to
            be a less costly alternative to perforated metal and wire cloth. The ability to engineer and fabricate
            expanded
            metal to any specific application yields a product uniquely suited to every end-use. Expanded metal can lose
            between 75%-80% of its weight and becomes stronger and more rigid than its previous state. Feel free to
            contact
            us for additional information and product pricing.</span>
